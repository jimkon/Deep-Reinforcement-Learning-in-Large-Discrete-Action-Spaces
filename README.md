Implementation of the algorithm in Python 3, TensorFlow and OpenAI Gym.



This paper introduces Wolpertinger training algorithm that extends the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient training algorithm introduced in [this](https://arxiv.org/abs/1509.02971) paper. 

I used and extended  **stevenpjg**'s implementation of **DDPG** algorithm found [here](https://github.com/stevenpjg/ddpg-aigym) licensed under the MIT license.
